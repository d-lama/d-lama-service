# D-LAMA Service

The *D-LAMA Service* is an independent API for other apps of the D-LAMA team. It uses the .NET Core 6.0.14 (LTS) framework, which allows deploying it on any platform. 

## Development
### Project setup
- **d-lama-service**: Domain logic
- **Data**: Database entity & Migrations
- **Test (to come)**: Unit test of domain logic

### Coding guidelines
- Use existing C# naming conventions
- General order:
    - 1. fields
    - 2. constructor
    - 3. public methods
    - 4. private methods
- Entity order:
    - 1. fields
    - 2. constructor
    - 3. navigation
    - 4. public methods
    - 5. private methods

### Database management
#### Initial setup
- Install SQL Express on your development machine

#### Deploy new database updates

- Open Package Manager Console in *Data* Project
- `Add-Migration $MigrationName` to create database changing code (e.g Add-Migration AddUser)
- `Update-Database` to deploy these changes (run the created db changing code)

#### Seed your database with test data
Currently there is no automatic data creation method available (will come...).
In order to work with data now, just seed your db with custom data using MSSQL Studio.

### Branching workflow
In our project we use the developer branching workflow.

- Development happens on a second long running branch (dev).
- Feature branches are created and merged to develop, and only if tested and stable merged to master.
